# TIY-2-3-T-Shirt Site

The Iron Yard Cincinnati week 3, day 1 assignment.  This assignment entailed taking our t-shirt page that we built and adding Javascript to and making it into a full website.  The site contains product, contact and about pages and uses [Bootstrap] (www.bootstrap.com) for the first time.  It is meant to reinforce HTML and CSS learned earlier in the course.
